# Energy_stable_RBF

Code for the paper "Energy-stable global radial basis function methods on summation-by-parts form" by Jan Glaubitz, Jan Nordström, and Philipp Öffner.
With the code the operators from section 5 can be reproduced.
Additionally, we have added the code to reproduce the numerical results from section 6. This is still work in progress and the operators are not optimized. To run the simulations, you should start scritpt_name for the different test cases.
